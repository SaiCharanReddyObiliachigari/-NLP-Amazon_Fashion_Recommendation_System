Worked on 183K with 19 features dataset where I have performed Data cleaning and understanding missing data in various features also removed duplicated rows.
Text-Preprocessing (Tokenization),
Stop words removal
Stemming
Converting text to an N-Dimensional vector (Bag of Words)
Featuring text based on word importance (TF-IDF)
Word2Vec (semantic similarity)
TF-IDF weighted Word2Vec and using color and brand of the products.
Also performed Deep Learning based visual product similarity (CNN) to find image edge, shapes and parts on the product.  
Used Keras + TensorFlow to extract features. 
Finally concluded using A/B testing for finding the best model.
